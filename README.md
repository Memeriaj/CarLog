# CarLog
A web based interface to input and display information about driven vehicles.

#### Installation
Running 'bower install' may prompt for which version of Angular to install. If so, letting it install 1.2.x will cause some errors and not render any pages. It'll work if you pick 1.3.x.  
The problem lays in the dependencies for one of the libraries and I'm not sure how to bypass the prompt right now.
